@KennethNorris here. Undergraduate Theatre major, Physics and Math minor.

Electrician and Stage technician for theatrical spaces and live performance venues.

Soon-to-be-published (keeping fingers crossed) co-author of a research paper on Access to Healthcare for Individuals with Down syndrome. Yeah, you can say I've had some experience with R.

Currently taking Introduction to Computer Science at Simpson College, so I'll learn Python eventually.
